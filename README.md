# Algorithms in JavaScript

Here is collection of algorithms implemented in JavaScript. They are separated in folders by their uses.

## Sorting

Here are the algorithms used to sort stuff.

- [Heap Sort](sorting/heapSort.js) - Sorts by building a heap with the elements to be sorted. Use it when you are concerned about the worst case scenarios.

- [Insertion Sort](sorting/insertionSort.js) - Sorts by inserting the elements on their correct positions. Use this on small collections or when the collection is almost sorted.

- [Quick Sort](sorting/quickSort.js) - Sorts by dividing the collection in two parts and sorting each part separatedly. This is best used when you want a good average-case behavior.
